- **Regions** is the place to find Pok√©mon in order to place an order. These Pok√©mon are categorized into different regions, the same analogy to that products are from different brands. After selecting a Pok√©mon, a short description about that Pok√©mon and the number available in stock will be displayed to the customer. On this page, they can either add the selected Pok√©mon to their cart or view their shopping cart.

## Highlights
### RESTful API
Pok√©Mart is designed to follow the REST architecture.   
The two HTTP methods that are utilized to set up communication between front-end and back-end are `GET` and `POST`.    
- `HTTP GET` are used to **retrieve information** from the back-end. Specifically, request of Pok√©mon list, order history, etc.    
- `HTTP POST` are used to **send information** from front-end to back-end. Specifically, send the customer information in the register page or login page.

### Authentication and Authorization
Instead of storing customer's password as raw string, a hash function is used to generate a unique string for each password. Also, a salt is also included in the hash-generated process to prevent precomputation attack although Pok√©Mart would never be attacked though üòé. The hash string is generated by using `Rfc2898DeriveBytes` class, which uses [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) hash function.

[JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) is used to authorize customer. For each request from an authorized customer, a JWT specific for this customer is included in the header of the HTTP request to provide the signature of the customer.

### Nearest Stores
To response to a request of nearest stores, a stored procedure in the database server will be called to produce three nearest stores to the specified location.    
> **Notes**: The stored procedure implementation can be found at `src\Database\distance_procedure.sql`.   

After receiving the result from the database server, back-end will wrap up the location of these stores and send back to front-end.
